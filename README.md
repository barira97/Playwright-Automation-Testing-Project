#  Swag Labs Automation Testing Project

Using Playwright + Page Object Model (POM)

##  Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end automation testing framework built using Playwright for the Swag Labs website (https://www.saucedemo.com/).

It automates login validations and multiple purchase journeys using the Page Object Model (POM) architecture.

The goal of this project is to validate critical user workflows such as:

-> Login failure handling

-> Successful product purchase

-> Sorting, filtering, checkout and logout flow

## Test Scenarios Covered

-> Login with locked_out_user

-> Verify the correct error message is displayed

### Q2 – Standard User Purchase Journey

-> Login with standard_user

-> Reset App State

-> Add any 3 products to the cart

-> Proceed to checkout

-> Verify product names & total price

-> Complete the purchase

-> Verify order success message

-> Reset App State and logout

### Q3 – Performance User Purchase Journey

-> Login with performance_glitch_user

-> Reset App State

-> Apply filter Name (Z to A)

-> Add first product after filtering

-> Checkout and verify:

   Product name

   Total price

-> Finish order

-> Verify success message

-> Reset App State and Logout
